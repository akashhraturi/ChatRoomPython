# ChatRoomPython

This is a chat room project created using python with the help of multi-threading and socket-programming.
To run it, download the both server.py and client.py files in your system.
Now open 3 CMD windows, one for the server monitoring the connection between the two clients.
In the server CMD, type 'python server.py' and hit enter. Our server will start accepting connections now.
In the second CMD window, type 'client server.py' and hit enter. The prompt will then ask for your nickname, enter it. You'll then be connected to the server.
In the third CMD, repeat the same procedure.
Server will tell you that both the connections are now connected and is ready to chat!
